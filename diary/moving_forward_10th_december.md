Majority of the thoery has been completed and the understanding behind how to

- evaluate
- understand
- breakdown
- and fix core issues like
- Mode collapse
- vanishing gradient
- convergence issues
Have all been investigated and understood to a deep understanding.

Moving ahead from the 10th of December, I will first load the basic dataset for the anime, and then develop the first several neural networks to process the data in order to have a live label collector prior to parsing it into a neural network.

I will also attempt to apply the articles that strongly correlate with the scope of my present project.
In doing so, I intend to get a better knowledge of the active label sythsis process from a coding standpoint.

In accordance with the labelling, I will also test the new variants of the models I will be building.
For instance, by combining wgan with conditional gans and so on, I am able to determine which generative network performs better with certain datasets or labels.
This will become a comparative research and a comprehensive summary and report will be available by the end of January.

I will also be considering changing the format of my final year project to a more research based approach using the universty template.

Furthering with this, to test the model, I hope that the university can let me use their servers to test these intensive models, that once again take ages to train.
