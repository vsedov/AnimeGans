# Feats

- Week 3 was a rather silent week, which consisted of me mainly reading all the papers and information that i had collected from week 2
- After reading the core papers, i found a new variant of animegans, which was introduced in 2021, this paper provided fruitful results, and very similar to concept to what i was tyin to accomplish, such that, i decided to dig deeper regarding the code base and the overall structure; Such that i had the principle of using a similar layout for my project.

- AnimeGan paper provided a few theories that would elevate and remove the core issues that generative networks entail, more over with anim√© datasets, such that it was the perfect paper for me to read. The paper did state that with poorly sythasised datasets, the generation will falter, at around 1k epochs.

# Observations

- ANIMEGANs is a generative network that is specifically designed to generate anime-style characters. This means that it has been trained on a large dataset of anime images, allowing it to produce more accurate results.
-ANIMEGANs is able to generate realistic character designs that are more consistent with the aesthetic of the popular anime genre.
- ANIMEGANs is also able to generate characters with a wider range of facial expressions, body movements, and poses. This makes it easier to create characters that are more expressive and believable.
- The network is also able to generate characters with accessories, such as glasses and hats, as well as hairstyles and clothing. This allows for a greater level of customization when creating characters.

What  this showed me is that a style feature network was crucial for the success of this project

# Self Observatrion and What Next

As stated, this week was rather dry and not too much progression was made, as i was merely outlying the core things that i needed to study and work on. Week 4 will be me looking more into style feature networks
