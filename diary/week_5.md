# Feat

- Looked into different network types
- Coded an initial gan with a full connected layer, but removed it and used a dcgan s  my core model, just because itprovided better results and the orignal gan from ian good fellows paper did not provide fruitful results compared to dcgans. Which is now the core model.
-
- I tried looking and trying to understand how to implement Wgan but i did not have enough time this week to give a comprehensive idea on  how to do it, i just understand how the loss function works.

- Look at how and what core parts of stylegans become hard to evaluate,  the observations are listed below, as the previous week i stated i would talk more about the generative networks. and How style gans work.

# Observation

The conclusion when evaluating a generative network was formed from the following:

- Compare the performance of different models on specific tasks, such as image generation or natural language processing, to determine which ones are most effective.

- Assess the quality of the outputs produced by different models, using metrics such as visual fidelity, diversity, and interpretability.

- Evaluate the scalability and robustness of different models, to determine how well they perform on large-scale datasets and under different conditions.

- Consider the ethical implications of using style GANs and generative networks, including issues such as privacy, bias, and the potential for misuse.

- Assess the potential applications and limitations of style GANs and generative networks, to understand how they can be used in various domains and what challenges they may face in the future.

# Self Observation and What Next

- Once again the week was quite rough with 3 course work, such that time was quite limited, although i tried to follow my original scope , and try catching up with the original plan.
