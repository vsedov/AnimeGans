# Feat

Ilustrationvec is a custom dataset that is used for machine learning tasks. It contains images and their associated attributes such as hair color and eye color. The dataset is processed and loaded using the AttrDataset class, which is a custom PyTorch dataset class.
such that i will most likely be continuing to move forward with the new scropt

# Observations

In my previous attempts using dcgans i realised that it really wasnt working and
all i was doing was training the data to output another set of data, which
really wasnt idea, i looked and found information regarding ulustrationvec,
which does the job that i had initially coded in the first place, but better,
through this i will most likely be able to parse in labels effectively, without
a loss of performance.

# Self Observation and What Next

To address the prior issues within the last weeks, i have decided to rewrite the
entire code base to see if i can implement the labels properly, as not only does
the previous models need to be changed but also how the data gets parsed through
