# Feat

- The first 3 days I read more about style feature networks and how they work with different datasets
- I further read a few more papers that are closely linked with aimegans; The paper stated the use case of dcgans for
the start and to test different datasets.
- Once again i fled to kaggle to look at different solutions and implement them for a better understanding .
Because I wanted to refresh my knowledge on DCGANws's, i decided to code some example code on how Dugan's work,such that if
required i can refer to later down the road, for a better explanation regarding generative networks.

# Observation

- Style Feature Networks are required to capture the global and local features of the images being generated, allowing the GAN to accurately generate realistic images.

- Style Feature Networks are necessary to capture the intricate details of the images, such as color, texture, and shape, which are important to generate realistic images.

- Style Feature Networks allow the GAN to learn the underlying structure of the image and use this information to accurately generate new images.

- Style Feature Networks are required to capture the style of the image, such as the composition and lighting, which is important for generating realistic images.

- Style Feature Networks are necessary for the GAN to capture the overall structure of the image, which is essential for the generation of realistic images.

# Self Observation and What Next

This week was more productive, although there was heavy coursework this week, which did not allow me to do as much work
as i had hoped. The code that i created for the DCGANS and convolutional networks was pushed to the repo.
