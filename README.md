# Final Year Project

# Comparitive study on how Gans work using Anime Face Data

Generating Facial images of Anime / Dogs and humans, via sketches and use of Deep Convolutional Gans
DCGAN.

Utilized PyTorch framework for development. Used a NVIDIA GeForce RTX Cards: GPU machine to facilitate training of the model.

Scope:
Datasets that are used:

- Cats and Dogs
- Actual Human Faces
- Anime Faces

### Cats and Dogs

After around 300 epochs, the generator has learnt some degree of how a dog would look like, despite this not being realistic. As indicated in my initial project plan, this was something I wanted to avoid before beginning work on the anime face data.

With the first placeholder and concept to analyse how gans function, followed by a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts to develop the process; resulting in more plausible graphics in the future.

With Cats and Dogs, the learning had little success after 200 epochs, as seen by the included photos and mp4 movies in this project.
Even though the pictures were distinct and there was limited mode collapse, there was a small amount of overfitting and the discriminator class had an excessive advantage over the generator class.

These photos were likewise of various sizes and required proper compression.
In addition, it seems that more data processing will be necessary, since there are some really poor photos that must be eliminated for this dataset to be viable.
