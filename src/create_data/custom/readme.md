# Anime dataset from danburu

If you want to use this dataset, it is wise to manually move some files around,
as i had not gotten around to automating it yet.

- Download the dataset through getdata.py
- Rename that given dataset with respect to its path items with number renamer.py you can parse in arguments and it should work
