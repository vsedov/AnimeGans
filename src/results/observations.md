# Observations of the following

# 10 - 10 - 400 epoch round

- After 200 steps of training with parameters -i 400 (400 iterations), an extra layer added to the generator, and a learning rate of 0.0001, the training produced decent outputs but failed after 200 iterations. The model was trained with an overwrite, starting with 10 iterations, followed by another 10, and finally with 400 iterations. Despite the promising results in the earlier stages, the training failed after 200 steps.
- There will be a test run of this going to 50 

# Core observations 
- Almost all my models tend to mode collapse after a cer
