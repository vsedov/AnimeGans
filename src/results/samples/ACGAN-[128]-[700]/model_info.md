## Model Readme

This model was trained with 700 epochs, with a batch size of 128 and an extra generator layer, using the default parameters for the
remaining model architecture. The aim of the model is to improve image quality.
However, during testing, it was observed that the output images are darkened, despite the number of epochs trained and additional generator
layer.
Upon closer analysis, it was discovered that the issue could be attributed to the batch size of 128. Larger batch sizes can lead to faster
training times, but they can also cause instabilities in the training process, leading to issues like the observed image darkening. It's
recommended to decrease the batch size to improve the quality of the generated images.
    To solve this problem, it's recommended to decrease the batch size and retrain the model to improve the image quality. Further optimization
of
the model architecture, like adjusting the activation, normalization, and loss functions, could also improve the generated image quality.
In conclusion, while the model has been trained with a high number of epochs and an additional generator layer, it's observed that the image
darkens out due to the high batch size, and adjusting this parameter would likely improve the quality of the generated images.
